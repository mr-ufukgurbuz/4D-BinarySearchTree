# 4D-BinarySearchTree

I build an algorithm that will take information related to students from text file and that will store in binary search tree. The algorithm 
will decide which one look for adding into BST according to depth level. The user can filter results in BST according to id, name, surname 
and numbers of internship by greater than or less than. Also, I did GUI using Windows API function in C and showed the results to user.
